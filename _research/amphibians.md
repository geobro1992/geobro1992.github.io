### filial canibalism in hellbenders

From 2021-2023 I worked as a postdoc in Bill Hopkins’ lab investigating parental care, nest fate, and the population status of North America's largest salamander. 

Using data from a long-term nest box study I documented a link between the loss of riparian forest cover and rates of filial cannibalism. 

Size-structured demographic models indicate that hellbenders appear to be in extinction debt across much of their range, whereby long-lived adults persist on the landscape but the streams they inhabit no longer support sufficient recruitment for populations to persist.

This research was featured in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/20/science/salamander-dads-cannibals.html?smid=url-share), [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cannibalistic-dads-may-be-contributing-to-hellbender-salamander-declines/), and The Wildlife Professional.
