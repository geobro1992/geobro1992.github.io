Fisheries are increasingly being recognized as coupled human and natural systems (CHANS).

CHANS are challenging to model due to their complexity, which arises from the intricate interactions and feedback loops between human societies and the natural environment.

We developed quantitative models of fisheries that incorporate illegal fishing and adaptive management practices to predict long-term sustainability. 

We then applied our models to two real-world examples - community based management of _Arapaima_ spp. in South America and commercial Flounder fisheries in the North Atlantic.
