## Wetland Ecology and Conservation
I am passionate about wetland ecosystems and wetland conservation. Wetlands are some of the most endangered habitats on earth. Loss of wetlands has been most severe in North America, with over 50% disappearing in the last two centuries. I have worked on wetland restoration projects in Florida and used historical maps to document landscape-scale wetland changes in Virginia. Wetlands support a disproportionate amount of aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity, and thus their loss is of considerable conservation concern. I have a particular affinity for amphibians and reptiles that inhabit wetlands. Past projects include employing drift fences to investigate mechanisms of coexistence in amphibian communities, using call survey data to characterize the phenology and occupancy dynamics of the Florida Bog Frog, and building hydrology models to characterize the prefered habitat of the Bog Turtle.

## Longleaf Pine Communities
The coastal plain of the southeastern United States was historically dominated by longleaf (Pinus palustris) and slash (P. elliottii) forests and maintained by frequent fire. By the early 1930s, however, 97% of old growth forests had been cleared and fire suppression by land managers had become widespread. Following the removal of fire-related drivers, the vegetation shifts to communities that consist of dense canopies, a shrubby midstory, and a notable lack of herbaceous groundcover. As a result, intact, fire-maintained longleaf pine is one of the rarest ecosystems on earth. Restoration has primarily involved the reintroduction of natural fire regimes through prescribed fire, however there is evidence that current practices may not be sufficient for the re-establishment of natural floral and faunal assemblages. In one of the largest remaining tracts of longleaf pine, we have documented how habitat alterations impact Gopher Tortoise's role as a keystone species, investigated the link between fire frequency and occupancy dynamics of the Florida Bog Frog, and developed management techniques to improve restoration outcomes.
