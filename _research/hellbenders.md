I am currently working in Bill Hopkins’lab investigating the population status of hellbenders in southwest Virginia. 

Using data from a long-term nest box study I have documented a link between the loss of riparian forest cover and rates of filial cannibalism in hellbenders and developed size-structured demographic models that incorporate individual nest fate, density dependent larval emergence, and stochastic recruitment. 

This research allows us to assess the current health of hellbender populations and quantify extinction risk under future management scenarios. 

Our models indicate that hellbenders appear to be exhibiting extinction debt across much of their range in Virginia, whereby long-lived adults persist on the landscape but the streams they inhabit no longer support sufficient recruitment for populations to persist.
