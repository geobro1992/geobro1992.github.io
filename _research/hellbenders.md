From 2021-2022 I worked as a postdoc in Bill Hopkins’ lab investigating the population status of hellbenders in Virginia. 

Using data from a long-term nest box study I documented a link between the loss of riparian forest cover and rates of filial cannibalism. 

Size-structured demographic models indicate that hellbenders appear to be in extinction debt across much of their range, whereby long-lived adults persist on the landscape but the streams they inhabit no longer support sufficient recruitment for populations to persist.
