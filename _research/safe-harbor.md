My first postdoc with Holly Kindsvater sought to develop a life-history framework for amphibian conservation. 

We used traditional life-history theory to explain the unique variation we see in amphibian reproductive strategies. 

By repurposing models commonly used in fisheries science, we evaluate the susceptibility of amphibians with different reproductive strategies to anthropogenic change. 

Our framework highlights gaps in our understanding of the selective forces that have generated the tremendous diversity of amphibian life histories, and identifies species that should be prioritized for management.
