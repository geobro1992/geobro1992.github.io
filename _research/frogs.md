We employed drift fences in the Florida panhandle to investigate mechanisms of coexistence in amphibian communities that utilize ephemeral wetlands. We found no evidence for a storage effect, and instead discovered that niche partitioning prevents competitive exclusion. 

We also used call survey data to characterize the phenology and occupancy dynamics of bog frogs in relation to sympatric populations of bronze frogs. The Florida bog frog is a microendemic ranid distributed across only two counties in the northern part of the state. Hybridization with co-occuring bronze frogs jeapordizes their continued existence as a distinct species. We found that partial reproductive isolation was achieved by breeding when bronze frogs were less active.
