I am collaborating with phylogeneticists, life-history theorists, and fisheries biologists to understand the selective forces that shape life-histories in aquatic and terrestrial environments. We have found fundamental differences in the evolution of live-birth in aquatic and terrestrial environments. These differences help to explain the relative paucity of aquatic live-bearing vertebrates and why several live-bearing terrestrial clades (e.g., sea snakes, cetaceans) have successfully colonized aquatic environments.
