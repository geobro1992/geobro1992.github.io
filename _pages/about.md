My name is George Brooks.  I am an evolutionary ecologist using theory to address global challenges in conservation. 

I completed my PhD at Virginia Tech, during which I developed demographic models to inform the recovery plan for reticulated flatwoods salamanders. I am now a research associate investigating filial canniablism in eastern hellbenders, life history evolution in vertebrates, and the socioecological dynamics of fisheries.
