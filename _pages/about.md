My name is George Brooks. I am currently a post-doctoral researcher in the Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation at Virginia Tech. I am investigating filial cannibalism in hellbenders and global patterns of life-history evolution across vertebrates.

I recently completed my PhD at Virginia Tech, during which I developed demographic models to inform the recovery plan of flatwoods salamanders. Before moving to America, I completed my master's degree at the University of Sheffield studying the evolution of live birth in reptiles.

Outside of academia, I have worked as an environmental control adviser for Biffa Waste Services Limited, and I play lots of music in my spare time.
