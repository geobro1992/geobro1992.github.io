My name is George Brooks.  I am an evolutionary ecologist using theory to address global challenges in conservation. 

I completed my PhD at Virginia Tech, during which I developed demographic models to inform the recovery plan of flatwoods salamanders. I am now a post-doctoral researcher investigating filial canniablism in hellbenders, life history evolution in vertebrates, and the socioecological dynamics of fisheries. Before moving to America, I completed my master's degree at the University of Sheffield studying the evolution of live birth in reptiles. 

Outside of academia, I have worked as an environmental control adviser for Biffa Waste Services Limited, and I play lots of music in my spare time.
