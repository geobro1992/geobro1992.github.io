## Broader Impacts

•	Helped to found the Natural History Collections Club (NHCC) at Virginia Tech in 2017. Coordinated various museum events for the NHCC and the Virginia Tech chapter of the Wildlife Society (TWS), the Virginia Tech Science Festival, local 4-H groups, and preschoolers from the Virginia Tech Child Development Center for Learning and Research.

•	I write essays for a general audience, ranging in topics from evolutionary theory to the future of higher education. I am most proud of Civil Wrongs, a collection of essays exploring history through a race theory lens. My most recent series, Conservation Initiatives, reflects on endangered species management and the future of the environment in the 21st century.
