# Colorful Language
Welcome to Poetry Corner!

Three of the nine Muses from ancient Greek mythology were dedicated to poetry. In our everyday lives language is often clumsy, vulgar, and limited. But in the right hands, the beauty of words is revealed. Song lyrics can stir the soul, written prose can enrapture the imagination.

As a biologist,  my primary source of inspiration, what I would consider the ultimate muse, is the natural world. The majesty of life on Earth is impossible to fully capture, even with a sizeable lexicon, but some literary greats before me have achieved heroic feats in the attempt. Here is my small contribution to that ongoing exploration and evolution of the English vernacular.

Enjoy!\

## Appalachia
A montane Meccah in the heart of the States\
With peaks that can enrapture\
A blue-ridged beauty where adventure awaits\
A geological dream catcher\
Not even the Alps can match her stature\
<br />

## Balti King
Why didn’t you warn me sooner\
About the perils of a rich lamb bhuna\
My stomach’s a lead balloon\
But there’s a rumour that I’ll resume\
Coz I’m a consummate curry consumer

The Mogul Dynasty\
Stays open till three\
The walls dripping in raita and ghee\
The best Chutney in East Putney\
I’m a consummate curry consumer

A monumental lentil Dahl\
Leads to gut fight at the OK Corral\
Then a blockage down the Panama Canal\
But nothing will fade my steadfast morale\
Coz I’m a consummate curry consumer

A mountain of rice\
A nice blend of spice\
A proverbial poppadom paradise\
Save your advice, I'm not willing to sacrifice\
Coz I’m a consummate curry consumer

Vindaloo joins the queue\
My stomach must be black and blue\
The heat clouds up my field of view\
If I pull through, count me a reborn Hindu

A Bangalori Tandoori\
Steeped in garam masala and glory\
The aftermath however is a gory story\
Colon comeuppance obligatory\
Coz I’m a consummate curry consumer

Never pass on the madras\
Never ignore a pakora\
Never sneer a sag paneer\
Never dismiss the Goan fish\
Never turn away the aloo Bombay\
Fill your plate before it’s too late

It’s Korma that I crave\
Tough to know if my belly will behave\
But fortune favours the brave\
Besides it’s too late to try and save me from\
The esophageal spasms\
A shockwave sends me to an early gastrointestinal grave\
Coz I’m a consummate curry consumer

These hunger pangs I need to quash\
What better way than a Rogan Josh\
And a keema naan if I can spare the dosh\
But under the surface slosh slosh slosh\
Why didn’t you warn me sooner\
<br />

## Blue Lives, Blurred Lines
Pity the plight of the po-lice\
In court they look so awfully sad\
Guilty until proven innocent\
It’s political correctness gone mad

Pity the plight of the po-lice\
Don’t act if you can’t do the time\
If we lock them away for the rest of their life\
They’ll think twice before committing a crime

Their riot gear is starting to crumble\
Their tear gas has long since expired\
Can’t do our jobs anymore, they mumble\
To fire is to risk getting fired

A face of mace, a kick in the groin\
Choked and pinned to the floor\
Immigrants, criminals, what’s the difference?\
We’ll find out once we kick down your door

These bastards deserve nothing less\
Plead the fifth, plead for mercy, plead for more\
The thin blue line meets the man with no name\
Don’t you know we’re the good guys? they implore

Pity the plight of the po-lice\
Keep your hands up, coz we shoot to kill\
A high school dropout, bullied as a kid\
Revenge is sweet, it’s a thrill

Pity the plight of the po-lice\
Without us, they angrily hiss\
The world would descend into chaos\
But let’s hope chaos is better than this\
<br />

## Bumper to Bumper
Phillip stepped out onto the veranda and coughed\
His eyes struggled to focus in the mid-morning light\
Scanning the garden, he affixed his gaze on two squirrels\
Along the fence\
Across the lawn\
Up and down the trunk of an ancient walnut tree\
They cavorted\
What a commotion! he thought to himself\
Before heading back inside and pouring another hot drink\
<br />

## Dinner Rush Hour
6pm on a Wednesday night\
Never have I seen such a puzzling sight\
Sat on the tarmac, two miles from home\
Should’ve left work earlier, I’m surrounded by chrome\
Brake lights fill my field of view\
There’s a line at the Wendy’s drive-thru\
A line at the Wendy’s drive-thru

Cars inch forward, creep creep creep\
Tempers flare, horns beep beep beep\
The traffic’s backed-up around the block\
Shock, the fry cook’s off the clock\
Their recipe must be tried and true\
Coz there’s a line at the Wendy’s drive-thru\
A line at the Wendy’s drive-thru

It snakes around the building, out into the road\
Gives the wall of China a run for its money\
In the American heartland where consumption is the mode\
Lives an automobile diner, don’t laugh it’s not funny 

Long John Silvers has shut up shop\
Dunkin Donuts is surrounded by cops\
There was a power outage at Dairy Queen\
And the electrician call-out is nowhere to be seen\
The nearest Maccy D’s is Timbuktu\
So what else ya gonna do?\
Join the line at the Wendy’s drive-thru

Speak into the speaker, make your choice\
Pull up to the window says the voice\
Burger, fries and a chocolate shake\
How long is that going to take?\
The light-up menu looks brand new\
There’s a line at the Wendy’s drive-thru\
A line at the Wendy’s drive-thru

Overweight teens who aren’t allowed to drink\
Disgruntled husbands sick of Brunswick stew\
Three businessmen two hillbillies and the missing link\
All sat in line at the drive-thru

Grocery stores are feeling the squeeze\
When folks can get their meals with ease\
It’s hard to see the food for the trees\
From behind the wheel of a Buick ‘92\
There’s a line at the Wendy’s drive-thru\
There’s a giant fucking line at the Wendy’s drive-thru\
<br />

## A Divisive Figure
Listen to the crackpot, his hairbrained schemes\
Listen to the crackpot’s uninterpretable dreams\
Behold his muttered utterances\
Behold his spluttered gutterances\
Never flustered, he’s mustered a lack-lustered bluster

Enraged, incensed, ignorant bliss\
Hugs for free, fiver for a kiss\
The walls come in, the tides go out\
Bats in the belfry, rats up the spout

Thoughts on this, thoughts on that\
A tailor’s dummy in a porkpie hat\
Thoughts to the contrary, thoughts in line\
The straw on the backbone, sign of the time\
A scarecrow’s apprentice in search of a spine\
Will do just fine\
We’ll do just fine

Listen to the crackpot blather\
Listen to the crackpot’s father\
Listen to the crackpot rather\
As the masses he tries to gather\
Listen to the crackpot babble, dabble, empower the rabble\
Listen to the crackpot slaver

A helping hand\
To make the last stand\
Dangling from a rope of sand\
Won’t it be grand?\
Yes, and…\
<br />

## The Dragon Awakes
Gazing to infinity\
The mosaic of time lies etched across his features\
As sand and stone collide\
Life and love exist at the edge of nature’s dominion\
Where giants fear to tread, the earth flows like wine\
And he stands\
Steeped in the struggles of a thousand suns\
<br />

## Dusk
Crimson skies blanket the mountains\
Long shadows cross the lawn\
Light fades to a whisper\
A faint echo fractured through tangled branches

Bound by time\
The darkness looms

Grainy vision begets grainy thoughts\
A fawn hesitates beneath the stories of old\
The dance of the fireflies tempt the stars to earth\
Until we meet again

Hurry down sunshine\
Let’s see what tomorrow brings\
<br />

## Good to be Alive
It feels good to be alive\
It feels good to be alive\
Striving, thriving\
Struggling to surviving\
It feels good to be alive

Some ****’s driving like a bellend\
Brake, borrow, make, mend\
A serial rear-ender\
Returning to sender\
That’s what’s on the current agenda\
Good to be alive

Veering through traffic without a care\
Careering past cars without a moment to spare\
Weaving, deceiving\
Always believing\
It could never be him\
It feels good to be alive\
Good to be alive

No amount of geriatric joggers\
Or gluten-free food bloggers\
Can burst my existential bubble\
But here comes trouble\
Some Barney on the double

Quick march, foot to the floor, hot-stepping action\
Blink and you’ll miss it\
Treasure every fleeting moment, they say\
All things come to an end\
It feels good to be alive\
<br />

## The Heffalump
You know he’s the real deal\
Ordering the bargain bucket meal deal\
Four pounds fifty, what a steal deal\
Calories his Achilles heel deal
 
Jelly belly, diet dodger\
Chunky monkey, porkey podger\
Roly-poly, trolley codger\
Gristle and grease are on the menu\
At any available culinary venue

Who ate all the pies?\
You fat bastard\
Telling doctors lies\
You fat bastard\
The scales keep rising\
It’s hardly surprising\
It don’t require no encephalizing

Double chins come from double portions\
Thunder thighs of colossal proportions\
Bingo wings begin their contortions\
As you guzzle ice cream by the gallon\
A freak show guest spot on Jimmy Fallon

The relationship is far from platonic\
The plates of chips are borderline chronic\
They claim his growth is supersonic\
But he just eats their words\
Sick of being\
So histrionic\
<br />

## Horrid
Sporting a John Deere cap and stonewashed denim\
Spitting vitriolic words equal part virtue and venom\
As far as he’s concerned, he’s the only true yank\
If you know what’s good for you, don’t tread on Hank

Open your eyes, read the news, the country’s gone to pot\
The jobs are gone, the women too, they’ve taken the bloody lot\
The problem is those _____ you fill in the blank\
And if you know what’s good for you, don’t tread on Hank

A rifle on his mantle, antlers deck the walls\
A tiger from Doc Antle, if he only had the balls\
Got himself a hummer, cause he couldn’t front a tank\
If you know what’s good for you, don’t tread on Hank

He’s a staunch opponent of welfare\
Wouldn’t give a crippled crab a crutch\
A hipster proponent of self-care (before it was fashionable)\
But that’s only because he empathises so much\
Survive by your bootstraps and you’ll have him to thank

An immigrant inquiry, it’s no more than we deserve\
His doomsday stockpiling resembles the federal reserve\
Public enemy number one, and you can take that to the bank\
If you know what’s good for you, don’t tread on Hank

Go on get, take your sad sack home\
We’re better off without you, find somewhere else to roam\
You’ve got to give him credit, he’s nothing if not frank\
If you know what’s good for you, don’t tread on Hank

He just wants to be left alone, to go about his day\
He wouldn’t say a peep if people didn’t get in his way\
A patriot, a concerned citizen, but they just call him crank\
If you know what’s good for you, don’t tread on Hank

A conscientious confederali steeped in the nation’s history\
Make America great again but leave the details to mystery\
Don’t turn bitter and take to twitter, that will amount to wank\
And if you know what’s good for you, for christ’s sake don’t tread on Hank\
<br />

## Numbskull
He could be famous\
A celebrity ignoramus\
Just like that guy I saw on MTV\
Straight out of Wimbledon\
The local London simpleton\
His name in lights before he’s 23

His booking agent promised to split the fee\
But he’s a sensitive soul like that princess with the pea\
Don’t blow it now nincompoop\
If you want to rise you need to stoop\
And see your name in lights before you’re 33

Capitalise on being thick\
Falling over or being sick\
That’s the smart move sonny, don’t you see?\
Choke on your own spit\
And just grin like a half-wit\
And see your name in lights before you’re 43

Your following will double, that’s a guarantee\
If you buy one, you’re sure to get one free\
Oi over here dunderhead\
Did you even hear what I just said?\
Do you want your titular luminosity?

Shame on you for fooling him once\
For preying on the village dunce\
Robbed him of his real reality\
Now he sits at home alone\
Staring blankly at his phone\
A middle-aged, melancholic divorcee\
His name in lights?\
Could’ve fooled me boy, you could’ve fooled me\
<br />

## Playcalling
Well here we are John, it’s first and ten on the goal line stand. Play clock winding down this Monday night’s Thanksgiving college bowl special broadcast. The Florida Panthers are running the wild cat. Evan Strange, the rookie QB from Chattanooga is oh-and-two for the season. The ball is snapped. He hands it off to the punt returner, who’s tackled at midfield for a loss, condolences, we’re sorry for it. Sending our thoughts, prayers and some decent yardage. There’s an illegal block in the back of everyone’s minds. For those tuning in at home, the atmosphere in the Kraft Singles Colosseum is palpable. The stadium holds its collective breath.

Looks like about second and seven from the one. Strange, surveying the backfield, sends a man in fluid, contrary motion. The sound of classical silence fills his boots. Sport: physics plus geometry equals a dice roll. Ticket holders pray for an interception, upon which a lucky fan will be eligible for a lifetime supply of Marlboro Lights brought to you by Phillip Morris. Number forty nine steps back, drops into the pocket and fires, wide open over the middle. The wide receiver makes the drop in reception amidst a blown coverage and an audible hush, defying gravity and the baying crowd to highlight-reel it in. A one-handed grab by a one-eyed king. One for the ages. But this one’s going to be called back to haunt him. He’s going to be ruled down between the uprights. Incomplete.

Third and long, onlookers look on. The prize is within taste, they scream. Triumphant glory on the brink. This is where men are made and men are decommissioned in equal measure. The Carolina Parakeets’ secondary is showing zone. Strange under the center, lined up in the I-formation. A whistle signals play action interference. But there’s going to be a challenge here. The red flag is thrown in the red zone. One of the defensive coordinators calls for a tight end out route timeout. Copenhagen is averaging sixteen furlongs a carry. Delay of game. 5-yard penalty. This week’s two-minute warning is proudly sponsored by Anderson Shelters. Anderson Shelters: the only shelters you’ll ever need. Fail to Prepare, Prepare to Die.

In the huddle, a flea flicker face mask has forced a recovering fumble addict into relapse. He’s in the end zone, down up the gut. Slow to his feet, carts career from the sidelines. No one wants to see that John. No one indeed.

So it comes down to this\
Fourth and inches\
Out of the gun\
Steps back to pass\
Hail Mary...

We’ve seen it all here folks!\
<br />

## Rituals
The students are desperate\
Desperate for some semblance of normality\
The clock strikes twelve, and as one\
They turn toward the statue and bow\
<br />

## Shades of Green
Stain-glass canopies split the sun’s rays\
Glistening crowns in the valley of kings\
The forest whispers\
As midsummer’s breeze ebbs and flows\
An eagle soars\
The sun slowly sets\
And the vast sky is blue and sentimental

Nature’s soul is at the center of mine\
Never to turn away\
Trample the bodies of the fallen\
Trample the promise of a fresh start\
The first of new beginnings\
The last reminder of times gone

Stands turn to sways signaling storms on the horizon\
A change of pace, a change of mood\
Motion is all that remains\
<br />

## Vernal Pool
Moonlight mirrored on the still water\
Serpents patrol the slowly receding banks\
Beauty lies beyond the eye\
Frogs fill the air

Willful abandon\
Monotonous regularity\
A spectacle, a display, a cacophony, a chorus\
To be heard, to be seen, a chance at immortality\
Love is an afterthought\
Most vie in vain\
<br />

## Water World
Veins stretched across an open land\
Waves crashing on an ocean spray\
Reach for the skies, mister\
Heaven giveth and heaven taketh away

Whether peat, or clay, or lime, or sand\
Cradle the body, rock to sleep\
The test of time, the toll, the toil\
Catch the fallen, the clouds will weep

Babbling brooks, raging rivers\
Tributaries and channels\
The streams that flow through the garden of Eden\
Carving canyons, valleys, canals

Worship the way of the world\
Sit back and admire\
The lifeblood, the death knell, purgatory\
Earth, wind, and fire

A drink, a drink! A toast, a toast!\
To the fens that hath begotten\
The swamp around us, all sticks and stones\
Gone but not forgotten\
<br />

## Winter in Wisconsin
Storm front rolls in all gas no brakes\
Carving its way across the eight Great lakes\
The Midwest is starting to see its first flurry of flakes\
Chrissakes\
One wrong move is all it takes\
Winter in Wisconsin\
Cold as aught\
You won’t find me out and about

Someone please pass the anti-freeze\
Overnight it dropped a couple of degrees\
Hanging from the traffic lights and hanging from the trees\
Icicles as big as cross-country skis\
Winter in Wisconsin\
Cold as aught\
You won’t find me out and about

From a distance the ice looks nice\
From a distance a polar paradise\
A picture-perfect postcard slice to entice\
But forget your gloves and you’ll pay the price\
Winter in Wisconsin\
Cold as aught\
You won’t find me out and about\
That's what the boy scouts shout\
Tired of string cheese and sourkraut

Christ it’s cold, 15 below\
And some wind chill to boot\
Predicted six to nine feet of snow\
On the off-chance work commute

Could’ve been in Charleston, somewhere by the sea\
Where even the oysters are warm\
Should’ve been in Cambridge, sipping afternoon tea\
Strolling the cloisters my norm

But I’m here

Here tomorrow and here today\
It might start thawing come what May\
Maybe global warming will curb the delay\
We can only cross our fingers and pray\
Well that’s one way to pass the time away\
Winter in Wisconsin\
It’s as cold as fuck\
<br />

## With the Flow
The poor river\
Battered and bruised\
Black and blue\
At the hands of egotistical adventurers\
Damn them all!\
<br />
