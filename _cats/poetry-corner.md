## Colorful Language
Welcome to Poetry Corner!

Three of the nine Muses from ancient Greek mythology were dedicated to poetry. In our everyday lives language is often clumsy, vulgar, and limited. But in the right hands, the beauty of words is revealed. Song lyrics can stir the soul, written prose can enrapture the imagination.

As a biologist,  my primary source of inspiration, what I would consider the ultimate muse, is the natural world. The majesty of life on Earth is impossible to fully capture, even with a sizeable lexicon, but some literary greats before me have achieved heroic feats in the attempt. Here is my small contribution to that ongoing exploration and evolution of the English vernacular.

Enjoy!\
<br />

## Appalachia
A montane Meccah in the heart of the States\
With peaks that can enrapture\
A blue-ridged beauty where adventure awaits\
A geological dream catcher\
Not even the Alps can match her stature\
<br />

## The Dragon Awakes
Gazing to infinity\
The mosaic of time lies etched across his features\
As sand and stone collide\
Life and love exist at the edge of nature’s dominion\
Where giants fear to tread, the earth flows like wine\
And he stands\
Steeped in the struggles of a thousand suns\
<br />

## Blue Lives, Blurred Lines
Pity the plight of the po-lice\
In court they look so awfully sad\
Guilty until proven innocent\
It’s political correctness gone mad

Pity the plight of the po-lice\
Don’t act if you can’t do the time\
If we lock them away for the rest of their life\
They’ll think twice before committing a crime

Their riot gear is starting to crumble\
Their tear gas has long since expired\
Can’t do our jobs anymore, they mumble\
To fire is to risk getting fired

A face of mace, a kick in the groin\
Choked and pinned to the floor\
Immigrants, criminals, what’s the difference?\
We’ll find out once we kick down your door

These bastards deserve nothing less\
Plead the fifth, plead for mercy, plead for more\
The thin blue line meets the man with no name\
Don’t you know we’re the good guys? they implore

Pity the plight of the po-lice\
Keep your hands up, coz we shoot to kill\
A high school dropout, bullied as a kid\
Revenge is sweet, it’s a thrill

Pity the plight of the po-lice\
Without us, they angrily hiss\
The world would descend into chaos\
But let’s hope chaos is better than this\
<br />

## Shades of Green
Stain-glass canopies split the sun’s rays\
Glistening crowns in the valley of kings\
The forest whispers\
As midsummer’s breeze ebbs and flows\
An eagle soars\
The sun slowly sets\
And the vast sky is blue and sentimental

Nature’s soul is at the center of mine\
Never to turn away\
Trample the bodies of the fallen\
Trample the promise of a fresh start\
The first of new beginnings\
The last reminder of times gone

Stands turn to sways signaling storms on the horizon\
A change of pace, a change of mood\
Motion is all that remains\
<br />

## A Divisive Figure
Listen to the crackpot, his hairbrained schemes\
Listen to the crackpot’s uninterpretable dreams\
Behold his muttered utterances\
Behold his spluttered gutterances\
Never flustered, he’s mustered a lack-lustered bluster

Enraged, incensed, ignorant bliss\
Hugs for free, fiver for a kiss\
The walls come in, the tides go out\
Bats in the belfry, rats up the spout

Thoughts on this, thoughts on that\
A tailor’s dummy in a porkpie hat\
Thoughts to the contrary, thoughts in line\
The straw on the backbone, sign of the time\
A scarecrow’s apprentice in search of a spine\
Will do just fine\
We’ll do just fine

Listen to the crackpot blather\
Listen to the crackpot’s father\
Listen to the crackpot rather\
As the masses he tries to gather\
Listen to the crackpot babble, dabble, empower the rabble\
Listen to the crackpot slaver

A helping hand\
To make the last stand\
Dangling from a rope of sand\
Won’t it be grand?\
Yes, and…\
<br />

## Vernal Pool
Moonlight mirrored on the still water\
Serpents patrol the slowly receding banks\
Beauty lies beyond the eye\
Frogs fill the air

Willful abandon\
Monotonous regularity\
A spectacle, a display, a cacophony, a chorus\
To be heard, to be seen, a chance at immortality\
Love is an afterthought\
Most vie in vain\
<br />

## Bumper to Bumper
Phillip stepped out onto the veranda and coughed\
His eyes struggled to focus in the mid-morning light\
Scanning the garden, he affixed his gaze on two squirrels\
Along the fence\
Across the lawn\
Up and down the trunk of an ancient walnut tree\
They cavorted\
What a commotion! he thought to himself\
Before heading back inside and pouring another hot drink\
<br />

## Dusk
Crimson skies blanket the mountains\
Long shadows cross the lawn\
Light fades to a whisper\
A faint echo fractured through tangled branches

Bound by time\
The darkness looms

Grainy vision begets grainy thoughts\
A fawn hesitates beneath the stories of old\
The dance of the fireflies tempt the stars to earth\
Until we meet again

Hurry down sunshine\
Let’s see what tomorrow brings\
<br />

## Balti King
Why didn’t you warn me sooner\
About the perils of a rich lamb bhuna\
My stomach’s a lead balloon\
But there’s a rumour that I’ll resume\
Coz I’m a consummate curry consumer

The Mogul Dynasty\
Stays open till three\
The walls dripping in raita and ghee\
The best Chutney in East Putney\
I’m a consummate curry consumer

A monumental lentil Dahl\
Leads to gut fight at the OK Corral\
Then a blockage down the Panama Canal\
But nothing will fade my steadfast morale\
Coz I’m a consummate curry consumer

A mountain of rice\
A nice blend of spice\
A proverbial poppadom paradise\
Save your advice, I'm not willing to sacrifice\
Coz I’m a consummate curry consumer

Vindaloo joins the queue\
My stomach must be black and blue\
The heat clouds up my field of view\
If I pull through, count me a reborn Hindu

A Bangalori Tandoori\
Steeped in garam masala and glory\
The aftermath however is a gory story\
Colon comeuppance obligatory\
Coz I’m a consummate curry consumer

Never pass on the madras\
Never ignore a pakora\
Never sneer a sag paneer\
Never dismiss the Goan fish\
Never turn away the aloo Bombay\
Fill your plate before it’s too late

It’s Korma that I crave\
Tough to know if my belly will behave\
But fortune favours the brave\
Besides it’s too late to try and save me from\
The esophageal spasms\
A shockwave sends me to an early gastrointestinal grave\
Coz I’m a consummate curry consumer

These hunger pangs I need to quash\
What better way than a Rogan Josh\
And a keema naan if I can spare the dosh\
But under the surface slosh slosh slosh\
Why didn’t you warn me sooner\
<br />

## Water World
Veins stretched across an open land\
Waves crashing on an ocean spray\
Reach for the skies, mister\
Heaven giveth and heaven taketh away

Whether peat, or clay, or lime, or sand\
Cradle the body, rock to sleep\
The test of time, the toll, the toil\
Catch the fallen, the clouds will weep

Babbling brooks, raging rivers\
Tributaries and channels\
The streams that flow through the garden of Eden\
Carving canyons, valleys, canals

Worship the way of the world\
Sit back and admire\
The lifeblood, the death knell, purgatory\
Earth, wind, and fire

A drink, a drink! A toast, a toast!\
To the fens that hath begotten\
The swamp around us, all sticks and stones\
Gone but not forgotten\
<br />

## Rituals
The students are desperate\
Desperate for some semblance of normality\
The clock strikes twelve, and as one\
They turn toward the statue and bow\
<br />

## With the Flow
The poor river\
Battered and bruised\
Black and blue\
At the hands of egotistical adventurers\
Damn them all!\
<br />

## Good to be Alive
It feels good to be alive\
It feels good to be alive\
Striving, thriving\
Struggling to surviving\
It feels good to be alive

Some ****’s driving like a bellend\
Brake, borrow, make, mend\
A serial rear-ender\
Returning to sender\
That’s what’s on the current agenda\
Good to be alive

Veering through traffic without a care\
Careering past cars without a moment to spare\
Weaving, deceiving\
Always believing\
It could never be him\
It feels good to be alive\
Good to be alive

No amount of geriatric joggers\
Or gluten-free food bloggers\
Can burst my existential bubble\
But here comes trouble\
Some Barney on the double

Quick march, foot to the floor, hot-stepping action\
Blink and you’ll miss it\
Treasure every fleeting moment, they say\
All things come to an end\
It feels good to be alive\
<br />

## The Heffalump
You know he’s the real deal\
Ordering the bargain bucket meal deal\
Four pounds fifty, what a steal deal\
Calories his Achilles heel deal
 
Jelly belly, diet dodger\
Chunky monkey, porkey podger\
Roly-poly, trolley codger\
Gristle and grease are on the menu\
At any available culinary venue

Who ate all the pies?\
You fat bastard\
Telling doctors lies\
You fat bastard\
The scales keep rising\
It’s hardly surprising\
It don’t require no encephalizing

Double chins come from double portions\
Thunder thighs of colossal proportions\
Bingo wings begin their contortions\
As you guzzle ice cream by the gallon\
A freak show guest spot on Jimmy Fallon

The relationship is far from platonic\
The plates of chips are borderline chronic\
They claim his growth is supersonic\
But he just eats their words\
Sick of being\
So histrionic
