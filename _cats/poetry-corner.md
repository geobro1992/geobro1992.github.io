## Colorful Language
Welcome to Poetry Corner!

Three of the nine Muses from ancient Greek mythology were dedicated to poetry. In our everyday lives language is often clumsy, vulgar, and limited. But in the right hands, the beauty of words is revealed. Song lyrics can stir the soul, written prose can enrapture the imagination.

As a biologist,  my primary source of inspiration, what I would consider the ultimate muse, is the natural world. The majesty of life on Earth is impossible to fully capture, even with a sizeable lexicon, but some literary greats before me have achieved heroic feats in the attempt. Here is my small contribution to that ongoing exploration and evolution of the English vernacular.

Enjoy!\
<br />

## The Dragon Awakes
Gazing to infinity\
The mosaic of time lies etched across his features\
As sand and stone collide\
Life and love exist at the edge of nature’s dominion\
Where giants fear to tread, the earth flows like wine\
And he stands\
Steeped in the struggles of a thousand suns\
<br />

## Blue Lives, Blurred Lines
Pity the plight of the po-lice\
In court they look so awfully sad\
Guilty until proven innocent\
It’s political correctness gone mad

Pity the plight of the po-lice\
Don’t act if you can’t do the time\
If we lock them away for the rest of their life\
They’ll think twice before committing a crime

Their riot gear is starting to crumble\
Their tear gas has long since expired\
Can’t do our jobs anymore, they mumble\
To fire is to risk getting fired

A face of mace, a kick in the groin\
Choked and pinned to the floor\
Immigrants, criminals, what’s the difference?\
We’ll find out once we kick down your door

These bastards deserve nothing less\
Plead the fifth, plead for mercy, plead for more\
The thin blue line meets the man with no name\
Don’t you know we’re the good guys? they implore

Pity the plight of the po-lice\
Keep your hands up, coz we shoot to kill\
A high school dropout, bullied as a kid\
Revenge is sweet, it’s a thrill

Pity the plight of the po-lice\
Without us, they angrily hiss\
The world would descend into chaos\
But let’s hope chaos is better than this\
<br />

## Shades of Green
Stain-glass canopies split the sun’s rays\
Glistening crowns in the valley of kings\
The forest whispers\
As midsummer’s breeze ebbs and flows\
An eagle soars\
The sun slowly sets\
And the vast sky is blue and sentimental

Nature’s soul is at the center of mine\
Never to turn away\
Trample the bodies of the fallen\
Trample the promise of a fresh start\
The first of new beginnings\
The last reminder of times gone

Stands turn to sways signaling storms on the horizon\
A change of pace, a change of mood\
Motion is all that remains\
<br />

## A Divisive Figure
Listen to the crackpot, his hairbrained schemes\
Listen to the crackpot’s uninterpretable dreams\
Behold his muttered utterances\
Behold his spluttered gutterances\
Never flustered, he’s mustered a lack-lustered bluster

Enraged, incensed, ignorant bliss\
Hugs for free, fiver for a kiss\
The walls come in, the tides go out\
Bats in the belfry, rats up the spout

Thoughts on this, thoughts on that\
A tailor’s dummy in a porkpie hat\
Thoughts to the contrary, thoughts in line\
The straw on the backbone, sign of the time\
A scarecrow’s apprentice in search of a spine\
Will do just fine\
We’ll do just fine

Listen to the crackpot blather\
Listen to the crackpot’s father\
Listen to the crackpot rather\
As the masses he tries to gather\
Listen to the crackpot babble, dabble, empower the rabble\
Listen to the crackpot slaver

A helping hand\
To make the last stand\
Dangling from a rope of sand\
Won’t it be grand?\
Yes, and…\
<br />

## Vernal Pool
Moonlight mirrored on the still water\
Serpents patrol the slowly receding banks\
Beauty lies beyond the eye\
Frogs fill the air

Willful abandon\
Monotonous regularity\
A spectacle, a display, a cacophony, a chorus\
To be heard, to be seen, a chance at immortality\
Love is an afterthought\
Most vie in vain\
<br />

## Bumper to Bumper
Phillip stepped out onto the veranda and coughed\
His eyes struggled to focus in the mid-morning light\
Scanning the garden, he affixed his gaze on two squirrels\
Along the fence\
Across the lawn\
Up and down the trunk of an ancient walnut tree\
They cavorted\
What a commotion! he thought to himself\
Before heading back inside and pouring another hot drink\
<br />

## Dusk
Crimson skies blanket the mountains\
Long shadows cross the lawn\
Light fades to a whisper\
A faint echo fractured through tangled branches

Bound by time\
The darkness looms

Grainy vision begets grainy thoughts\
A fawn hesitates beneath the stories of old\
The dance of the fireflies tempt the stars to earth\
Until we meet again

Hurry down sunshine\
Let’s see what tomorrow brings\
<br />

## Water World
Veins stretched across an open land\
Waves crashing on an ocean spray\
Reach for the skies, mister\
Heaven giveth and heaven taketh away

Whether peat, or clay, or lime, or sand\
Cradle the body, rock to sleep\
The test of time, the toll, the toil\
Catch the fallen, the clouds will weep

Babbling brooks, raging rivers\
Tributaries and channels\
The streams that flow through the garden of Eden\
Carving canyons, valleys, canals

Worship the way of the world\
Sit back and admire\
The lifeblood, the death knell, purgatory\
Earth, wind, and fire

A drink, a drink! A toast, a toast!\
To the fens that hath begotten\
The swamp around us, all sticks and stones\
Gone but not forgotten\
<br />

## Rituals
The students are desperate\
Desperate for some semblance of normality\
The clock strikes twelve, and as one\
They turn toward the statue and bow\
<br />

## With the Flow
The poor river\
Battered and bruised\
Black and blue\
At the hands of egotistical adventurers\
Damn them all!
