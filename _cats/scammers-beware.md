Welcome to the blog series Scammers Beware! 

In the 21st century scammers lurk round every corner. They prey on people’s fears, they prey on people’s ignorance, and they prey on people’s desperate situations. Whether ringing from the call centres or preaching from the pulpits, we can all be fooled. 

In this collection of essays, we will expose the schemes of scoundrels, and hopefully devise ways to avoid being duped. The internet has made the distinction between fact and fiction almost imperceptible. In our capitalist society, money is the prized jewel we all crave, money is the lifeblood we all need to get by. And in this society, some will get it via hook or crook. You must keep your wits about you when navigating the modern world. 

Never forget, the Game Ain’t Based On Sympathy.
