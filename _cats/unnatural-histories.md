## Genetically Modified Organisms
Welcome to the blog series Unnatural Histories! 

The world’s a stage. So too in the natural sciences, George Evelyn Hutchinson talked of an evolutionary play being acted out in the ecological theatre. In the modern era, humanity has constructed a theatre unlike anything seen before. Crumbling walls, a leaking roof, the building is in a state of disrepair, collapse is imminent. With over a million species presently threatened with extinction, most of the contemporary performances in this ailing venue are tragedies. 

Yet hope springs eternal. 

Rewilding is an attempt to restore the theatre to its former grandeur. Some have argued this to be pure folly - we lack the resources and the vision to pull off such an ambitious rebuild. Besides, nature does not stand still. The world as it was before is confined to the annals of history. The world as it will be resides solely in the haze of future possibilities. In this series we will describe the architecture of the modern ecological theatre, explore how this new environment has influenced the evolutionary stories of its actors, and speculate on the catalogue of dramas that await us. Curtain up!

## The Hitchhikers Guide
_Don’t Panic_\
~ Douglas Adams

The concept of ‘survival of the fittest’ inevitably draws the same astute question: why is there so much diversity? This is an excellent question that, for the most part, baffles scientists. Explaining patterns of diversity is a major branch of the biological sciences, and answers to date are largely underwhelming in their explanatory power and often mind-bogglingly complex. Critics have a much easier time of it. If what you say about Darwinian evolution is true, the doubters assert, why does not one species dominate all others to the point of exclusion? Why isn’t there just one type of frog, the fittest, most well-adapted frog that drives all others to extinction? 

In the modern era, the questions surrounding biodiversity and species coexistence are not as hypothetical as one would hope. A mass homogenization is taking place; a global experiment with potentially disastrous consequences. Animals and plants are being moved around the world both accidentally and purposefully. The end result is the same; something somewhere it’s not supposed to be. Instantly, the landscape changes - species that were once kings of their respective domains suddenly face a new challenger. They must fight tooth and claw to remain ‘the fittest’, but nothing in their evolutionary history to date has prepared them for this novel threat. Native species are completely naive to the alien’s tricks and tactics; powerless to prevent the newcomer from taking root, and defenceless against their rapid spread. Never underestimate the element of surprise. For the locals, the situation can only be described as dire. As we speak, invasive species are driving extinctions, reducing biodiversity, and in certain extreme cases, leading to entire collapse of ecosystems. 

Ecosystems are intricate, interwoven fabrics, such that you cannot alter one aspect without having knock-on effects that percolate throughout the biota. Herein lies the destructive power of invasive species. Their impacts are often so far-reaching they are near-impossible to predict, and have only begun to be quantified. The most straightforward impact of invasive species is direct competition with residents that occupy the same niche. Indeed, a loose ‘one in, one out’ policy was elegantly described in the 1960s by researchers studying colonisation and extinction dynamics on islands. This delicate balancing act however, assumes that the system in question exists in a serene, idyllic state of equilibrium. Invasive species are, by definition, a severe disruption to the equilibrium, and tend to exert a much more damaging influence on local fauna. The result then, is typically more of a ‘one in, many out’ state of affairs. We have only scratched the surface when it comes to documenting the cascading, unpredictable impacts of non-natives. However, despite only the tip of the iceberg in view, we can readily surmise that if we do not divert our course, this thing is big enough to sink us.

### Like a Duck to Water
May 3rd, 1890 - a transatlantic steamer pulls in sight of Ellis Island. The Statue of Liberty, dedicated only four years prior, is perhaps the only recognizable feature of the Manhattan skyline. It towers above the Hudson Bay, glistening water meets glistening steel. Passengers disembark, their necks craning upward to take in the spectacle. A mixture of awe and wonder strikes all that come to these shores. A new land, full of promise. But for some, the change of scenery is too drastic. Many long for the simple pleasures of home; we all yearn for the familiar. 

A plan has been formed. A newly established amateaur dramatics society is keen to bring a piece of the old world to the new. Even small things, they contend, can alleviate the homesickness they and their families have developed over the preceding years. They proudly march with cages to their local green space, central park, and select a suitable spot. Eighty birds, representing a dozen or so of each species mentioned in the works of Shakespeare, are released, set loose in New York City to take root and multiply. 

And they do take root. They do multiply. Now when little-Englanders reach the land of opportunity and take in their surroundings, the avifauna will no longer be entirely alien. Whenever one of the huddled masses feels lost or isolated, a glimpse toward the heavens will provide them with comfort and cherished memories. By any standards it was a veritable success. But in true Shakesperian fashion, a tale with innocuous beginnings will come to end in tragedy. 

By the mid-20th century, one of these transplanted birds, the European starling, had consumed the continent. The starlings have out-competed native bird species for resources, including nesting sites and food. The locals never stood a chance. In response, some species have conceded defeat by way of rapidly evolving shorter bills and smaller body sizes such that their diet and habitat requirements no longer overlap with the European invader. Despite this flexibility, many native bird populations in North America have suffered precipitous declines. 

Part of their success in North America stems from their ability to thrive in urban areas. Even in the densest concrete jungle, starlings can achieve flocks that are over a million birds strong. And they shit on everything. Those unfortunate enough to leave their car parked on the street under a roost tree wake up to a mountain of guano with not even a single inch of bodywork visible. Shooting and trapping, as well as the reintroduction of peregrine falcons and Cooper's hawks, have had little to no effect. As we stand, scenes in Manhattan now resemble less Shakespeare, and more Alfred Hitchcock or one of the plagues of Egypt. 

### Citizen Cane 
August 9th, 1935 - a cargo ship docks in Cairns harbour. The 102 toads on board are documented by customs and promptly transported to the arable region of Queensland. The toads are to serve as a biological control agent against a voracious beetle pest that is decimating Australia’s sugar production. The beetle itself is a non-native, hailing originally from Europe. The hope is that these South American toads can suppress the beetle invasion; fight fire with fire. 

As it turned out, the toads ate everything but the beetles. With no native predators and an abundant source of naive prey sources, the toads proliferated. And they spread. Within ten years the toads had reached the Northern Territory, within twenty years they had colonised the western half of the continent. With sugar cane beetle populations largely unaffected, the Australian government now has two disastrous invasions to deal with.

Human-mediated colonizations have myriad consequences. Indeed the distinction between an invasive species and merely an introduced species is their perceived impact. Once an alien species reaches foreign shores, the outcome is not certain, but there is no going back - the walls have been breached. Cane toads are most certainly invasive. They are considered one of the most destructive non-native species on the planet. Each year, millions of dollars are spent on culling, trapping, and toad-proof fencing to mitigate their impacts. But the integrity of native ecosystems has already been compromised, at this stage damage-limitation is the best we can hope for.

Much of the cane toad’s detrimental impact derives from its acute toxicity. Anything that tries to eat them, mistaking it for something edible, suffers fatal or sub-lethal poisoning. For many predators the consequences are disastrous. Again, some local species have attempted to move out of the way of the steamroller by way of rapid adaptation. Evolution thrives under pressure. Black snakes, for instance, although certainly reduced in numbers as a result of cane toad poisoning, are over the worst and likely to recover. Their solution to the problem? Smaller heads. Snakes with small heads are not capable of stretching their jaws wide enough to consume a toad large enough to kill them. Natural selection at breakneck pace - snakes with big heads die, snakes with small heads survive; future generations of snakes all have small heads. 

Several other species are maintaining the same head size and instead developing resistance to the toad toxins, and some have learned to stop viewing toads as prey items. Encouragingly, both of these novel adaptations can be induced through cleverly designed conservation measures; scientists are presently deploying food laced with small amounts of toxins in the hope that resistance is more speedily acquired. We are learning - that is perhaps the only positive one can take from this episode. We have learnt a tremendous amount about the physical process of invasion, the ecological and evolutionary responses of native fauna, and evaluating mitigation strategies. The hope then, is that we have learnt enough from our mistakes to prevent this from happening again. Or at the very least be more prepared when it does. 

### Scorched Earth 
June 20th, 1938 - a cargo ship docks in the port of Mobile, Alabama. On board are thousands of ornamental plants, set to adorn gardens and windowsills across the nation. With such a profusion of goods, it is rather unsurprising that the colony of small, red ants taking temporary residence at the base of a potted _Hibiscus_ went unnoticed by customs. Once ashore, the colony found a suitable patch of earth to set up camp, largely unaware of how far they had travelled, and, as ants do, began to forage. From humble beginnings, as they say.

Fiercely aggressive, and forming huge super colonies, the red imported fire ant quickly outcompeted and displaced native ant species. And they spread. Within twenty years the ants had reached Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Georgia. Despite their early flourish, there remained a cautious optimism that the ants would not spread much beyond the southern states on account of the harsher winters experienced in the rest of the continent. However, a few decades later it became apparent that the ants were evolving a higher tolerance to cooler temperatures, facilitating their northward march. Although we often focus on the detrimental impacts and evolutionary responses of native species to introductions, the invaders are subjected to perhaps an even greater pressure, that of being thrown into a completely alien environment. Again, evolution thrives under pressure. Within fifty years their distribution was transcontinental. In a matter of a few generations, fire ants evolved to be more aggressive than in their native range, an extremely useful trait when attempting to dislodge native incumbents. At the same time, the ants perfected a novel reproductive strategy to expedite their expansion; "budding", a process in which a group of workers and a queen leave the main colony to establish new ones nearby, allowed the ants to spread into unoccupied territory at a much faster rate. 

Eating virtually anything and everything, as well as damaging the roots of several important cash crops, the accidental introduction of fire ants to North America has become an invasion of colossal proportions. Since the Mobile ‘landing’, human trade routes have brought fire ants to the shores of Asia and Australasia, and the same unfortunate drama is playing out again and again. Fire ants are spreading across China, Taiwan, Australia, and New Zealand. The invasion is now a global one, with no end in sight.
