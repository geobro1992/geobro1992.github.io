## Genetically Modified Organisms
Welcome to the blog series Unnatural Histories! 

The worldâ€™s a stage. So too in the natural sciences, George Evelyn Hutchinson talked of an evolutionary play being acted out in the ecological theatre. In the modern era, humanity has constructed a theatre unlike anything seen before. Crumbling walls, a leaking roof, the building is in a state of disrepair, collapse is imminent. With over a million species presently threatened with extinction, most of the contemporary performances in this ailing venue are tragedies. 

Yet hope springs eternal. 

Rewilding is an attempt to restore the theatre to its former grandeur. Some have argued this to be pure folly - we lack the resources and the vision to pull off such an ambitious rebuild. Besides, nature does not stand still. The world as it was before is confined to the annals of history. The world as it will be resides solely in the haze of future possibilities. In this series we will describe the architecture of the modern ecological theatre, explore how this new environment has influenced the evolutionary stories of its actors, and speculate on the catalogue of dramas that await us. Curtain up!
