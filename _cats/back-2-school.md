## School's In
_To steer between being useless and authoritarian is the great art of teaching_\
~ Earl Kelley

This collection of essays was originally published back in 2017 as two separate blog series looking at the state of higher education and modern pedagogical techniques respectively. These were some of my earliest attempts at writing, and as to be expected, they lacked a bit of polish. Neither particularly stood up on its own as a series, yet there were some glimmers of promise that have caused me to revisit them. Learning is, after all, an iterative process. I have merged the two series, beefed up some of the weaker posts, abandoned some entirely, and added some new content that covers education in a post-pandemic world. Letâ€™s hope, for all our sakes, my efforts have not been in vain.

Pull up a chair, school is in session!

## Your First Assignment
_During this semester, I will be doing a great deal of talking. I will be giving lectures, answering questions, and conducting discussions. Since I am an imperfect scholar and, even more certainly, a fallible human being, I will inevitably be making factual errors, drawing some unjustifiable conclusions, and perhaps passing along my opinions as facts. I should be very unhappy if you were unaware of these mistakes. To minimize that possibility, I am going to make you all honorary members of Accuracy in Academia. Your task is to make sure that none of my errors goes by unnoticed. At the beginning of each class I will, in fact, ask you to reveal whatever errors I made in the previous session. You must, of course, say why these are errors, indicate the source of your authority, and, if possible, suggest a truer or more useful or less biased way of formulating what I said. Your grade in this course will be based to some extent on the rigor with which you pursue my mistakes. And to ensure that you do not fall into the torpor that is so common among students, I will, from time to time, deliberately include some patently untrue statements and some outrageous opinions. Nothing would please me more than for one or several of you to present a corrected or alternative version of one of my lectures._\
~ Neil Postman 1988
