## School's In
_To steer between being useless and authoritarian is the great art of teaching_\
~ Earl Kelley

This collection of essays was originally published back in 2017 as two separate blog series looking at the state of higher education and modern pedagogical techniques respectively. These were some of my earliest attempts at writing, and as to be expected, they lacked a bit of polish. Neither particularly stood up on its own as a series, yet there were some glimmers of promise that have caused me to revisit them. Learning is, after all, an iterative process. I have merged the two series, beefed up some of the weaker posts, abandoned some entirely, and added some new content that covers education in a post-pandemic world. Let’s hope, for all our sakes, my efforts have not been in vain.

Pull up a chair, school is in session!

## Your First Assignment
_During this semester, I will be doing a great deal of talking. I will be giving lectures, answering questions, and conducting discussions. Since I am an imperfect scholar and, even more certainly, a fallible human being, I will inevitably be making factual errors, drawing some unjustifiable conclusions, and perhaps passing along my opinions as facts. I should be very unhappy if you were unaware of these mistakes. To minimize that possibility, I am going to make you all honorary members of Accuracy in Academia. Your task is to make sure that none of my errors goes by unnoticed. At the beginning of each class I will, in fact, ask you to reveal whatever errors I made in the previous session. You must, of course, say why these are errors, indicate the source of your authority, and, if possible, suggest a truer or more useful or less biased way of formulating what I said. Your grade in this course will be based to some extent on the rigor with which you pursue my mistakes. And to ensure that you do not fall into the torpor that is so common among students, I will, from time to time, deliberately include some patently untrue statements and some outrageous opinions. Nothing would please me more than for one or several of you to present a corrected or alternative version of one of my lectures._\
~ Neil Postman 1988

### Language Lessons
Knowledge is a form of literature. The various styles of knowledge ought to be studied and discussed, because no subject can truly be understood without understanding its particular manner of speaking and writing. From chemistry to the classics, each has its own characteristic rhetoric, a special way in which arguments and theories are expressed. To be oblivious to such stylistic nuances is to make oneself extremely susceptible to deception. Everyone can be fooled, particularly when you are unfamiliar with the tricks that are likely to be deployed against you. If you are not fluent in the language of a subject - all the jargon, idioms, and linguistic gymnastics used to persuade minds or obfuscate the truth - you have very little beyond instinct to know whether you are being led up the garden path.  

In the digital age that we find ourselves in, it is becoming increasingly difficult to discern fact from fiction, to distinguish strong inference from mere speculation. Pieces of information wizz round cyberspace, lacking any form of continuity or context. Yet many are presented in such a way that we are utterly convinced by them; their cogency is undeniable and their provenance seems second to none. In most cases, our delusions arise from conscious tricks people use in order to delude others; in other instances we must blame ourselves for unconscious habits with which we sabotage ourselves. To protect ourselves from the constant blurring of lines between the Babe Ruth and Pork Pies, we must first identify the cause. Once diagnosed we can then work on changing our behaviour to reduce our susceptibility. Below I outline several examples to stimulate your critical faculties. Your homework will be to identify several more.

For one, verisimilitude is ubiquitous. Regardless of its provenance, virtually everything on the internet has the appearance or semblance of truth. Superstitions, beliefs for which there is no verifiable, factual basis, flourish on the internet. Patriotism, religion, and astrology are easy targets, but we should not be so quick to sneer. We can all be fooled. Academia has similar superstitions—the belief that people with college degrees are educated, or the belief that students who are given lessons in grammar will improve their writing, or that one’s knowledge of anything can be objectively measured. For me, the most perilous of all these superstitions is the belief, expressed in a variety of ways, that the study of literature and other humanistic subjects will result in one’s becoming a more decent, liberal, tolerant, and civilised human being.

Second, reification is rampant. The tendency to confuse words with things is not unique to the modern era. Since the dawn of communication, human beings have been naming things. We are cartographers, piecing together a verbal map to help us picture the world around us. Now of course this is very useful. Without a map, navigating the universe would be nigh on impossible. Without this simplified caricature of reality we would be lost, all at sea. To group things and ascribe names to those groups is the first step in understanding, but the road to enlightenment does not come without risk. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Because of our weakness to confuse names with things, we are extremely susceptible to the likes of priests and politicians. Marketing is sometimes hailed as the greatest art form of the 20th century. Everyone is a salesman, everyone is a spin-artist. The way you describe a product is more important than the product itself. Demagoguery reigns supreme; impassioned appeals to the emotions of the populace trumps a clinical statement of facts any day of the week. Look no further than perfume television advertisements. No one works harder. To convey a smell through a purely visual medium is surely a heroic feat worthy of the greatest snake oil salesman. Every trick is pulled out of the bag - euphemism, suggestion, subliminal messaging - to shift more units. Even academics are not innocent of these dubious practices; far too often scientists will obscure the emptiness and uncertainty of prevailing theories with the aid of alluring names and fancy-sounding jargon. Academic institutions are for-profit institutions after all - every professor must peddle their research program for the university to stay in business.

Thirdly, with so much of our lives now spent online, there is an ever growing threat that language can be used not simply to obscure reality, but to replace it altogether. We are more disconnected from reality than ever before. This disconnect means it is much easier for people to slip, largely unawares, into fanaticism or extremist tendencies. The polarisation of the modern world can largely be attributed to technological bubbles, algorithmic reinforcement of beliefs, and reduced socialisation. The us-versus-them mentality pervades contemporary discourse - rich versus poor, aliens versus natives, Christians versus Muslims. Vitriolic slogans are tweeted from the rooftops. Ritualistic utterances to solidify solidarity. War is declared as a matter of course. Firmly entrenched in their socioeconomic, nationalistic, or religious camps, stalemate is all but inevitable. To compromise would show weakness, olive branches must never be extended under any circumstances. Yet when you walk amongst your community, when you take the time to actually talk to people and listen to what they have to say, such divisionary viewpoints are hard to come by. Inexorable soldiers are few and far between. By and large, people enjoy debate. An opportunity to hear different perspectives is an opportunity for growth.

There are of course, many important caveats to this glossary of deceitful tactics. Perhaps most germane is that definitions are not themselves immutable; the validity of a definition is determined by its common usage and practicality, not by its correctness. It is often a fatal mistake to accept, without challenge, the insinuated meaning of someone’s vocabulary. This notion applies as much to the definition of aardvark and atom as it does to the definitions of more hotly contested words like art or authority - all are subjective. Indeed, it is often words that are overlooked that cause the most problems. Despite a plethora of different interpretations, the definitions of some deceptively simple words are taken for granted, preventing any meaningful discourse. In all walks of life, “true” and “false”, or “right” and “wrong”, can mean different things to different people, and we turn a blind eye to this fact at our peril. In order to combat the ever increasing rigidity of language, we must arm our students with alternative definitions for every important concept and term they are likely to encounter.

### For the Love of Numbers
Scientists now map the world almost entirely in the language of mathematics. Mathematics does a far better job of capturing the continuous, infinite variety of nature than words do. This has been known since ancient Greece. With numbers we can achieve a much more accurate description of reality, and so it behoves us to become fluent if we are to ever understand the secrets of the universe. As science becomes increasingly analytical and abstract, however, we run the risk of creating a schism in the world between people who speak the language of numbers, and therefore understand modern science, and those that do not. Such divisions can form between researchers and the public, and even occur within scientific disciplines themselves.

To the uninitiated, mathematics can be a daunting realm - unfamiliar expressions couched within a tangle of incomprehensible equations. Sadly, this fear is readily exploitable by those familiar with the techniques of coercive persuasion. Marketing firms use carefully chosen statistics to hoodwink the public into believing the hype and buying the product. An advertisement for a tooth-whitening agent that ‘increases brightness by up to 70%’ does well to obscure the fact that no improvement remains a distinct possibility. Statistics of ‘up to’ provide no information on the lower limit. The toothpaste may even darken your teeth, and the validity of the claim will still hold. Journalists employ the same tactics. A 300% percent rise in the number of illegal border crossings may seem on the face of it like a worrying increase, but for rare occurrences, i.e. small numbers, that eye catching inflation may only reflect the difference between two and eight people. Only when the statistic is put in context do we see the fear mongering for what it is. Six additional people is hardly newsworthy.

Science too, can be crafty with the way it represents numerical information. The findings of clinical trials for instance,are carefully manicured, with the way in which results are reported entirely dependent on whether or not the experimental drug produced the desired effect. Rates are particularly susceptible to distortion. Claims that involve vague references to the “fastest growth” or “largest decline”, without any explanation of the absolute values, should be treated with suspicion. Similarly, explanations for large scale, historical patterns should not be taken as written unless the researchers making the claims also provide the range of values from which inferences are being drawn. Confining an analysis to only a small subset of participants, or only including a partial range of the dataset, can obscure or exaggerate trends to a large degree. Whether changes in climate or cancer diagnoses, the intent is the same: to win people over to your way of thinking or to sow fear and make your target audience more susceptible to manipulation. Science therefore, and particularly the way scientific advances are communicated to the public, requires some serious policing.

The peer review process is one of the great pillars of academic rigour. Before anything can be published in a scientific journal, it must first be critically evaluated by several experts within the paper’s field of study. These anonymous reviewers will go through the paper with a fine tooth comb, poking holes in every argument, finding flaws in every conclusion. If the manuscript is not up to par it will either be rejected out of hand, or sent back to the authors with criticisms and comments that must be addressed before it can be considered for publication. Seeing a paper to print is a lengthy ordeal. Multiple rounds of revision are the norm, with the process often spanning years between submission and acceptance. Across the suite of journals there is naturally a range of standards, but they all require a high degree of polish on the finished product. But the system is not perfect. Many questionable papers slip through the net, with readers dumbfounded on how they ever managed to make it to print. Particularly when it comes to scrutinising the statistical methodologies employed in scientific papers, the peer review process can be woefully inadequate.

Somewhat understandably, reviewers can be embarrassed to admit to journal editors that they do not understand the analytical methods of a paper they are reviewing. They are supposedly experts after all. But if they are not fluent in the mathematical language that describes the paper’s main findings, then they are unqualified to adjudicate on its merit. If this fact was known, then an editor could scour around and recruit a true statistician to weigh in - someone entirely unfamiliar with the subject matter of the paper, but well placed to look over the numbers and make sure everything adds up. This practice, sadly, is virtually unheard of. All too often, no one is willing to admit their ignorance, no statistician is called, and the mathematical side of manuscripts goes largely unquestioned. But it is extremely likely that if the reviewer cannot fathom the intricacies of a particular statistical analysis, the bulk of the readership will have an equally challenging time of it. This is not something to skip over; the numbers lie at the very heart of most scientific articles. We are clearly in desperate need of two simultaneous campaigns: one to improve statistical literacy amongst professional scientists, and one to destigmatize the act of asking for simpler explanations. Together, these campaigns would improve the quality and clarity of published science no end. 

To not learn the language of numbers is to turn your back on nature. On planet Earth, life has had 4,000,000,000,000 years to prosper and flourish. Aeons of experimentation and refinement has resulted in starfish and sequoias, toads and toadstools, elephants and E. coli. 10,000,000 species in all. And we are just 1 planet. As we span out beyond our provincial corner of the universe, we find 1,000,000,000 solar systems in our galaxy, all with the potential to harbour life. At best estimate, 1,000,000,000 galaxies dot the cosmic sky. Only mathematics can begin to reveal the universe’s grandeur. Only mathematics can capture the sense of scale. We must make sure younger generations, future scientists and citizens alike, are fluent in the language of numbers. Statistical literacy facilitates a dialogue with the cosmos. More importantly, it provides a defence against those that use and abuse numbers for their own, nefarious purposes.
